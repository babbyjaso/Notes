- python supports different types of numbers
	- Integers [[Variables and data types#^integers]]
	- Float ^float
		- useful for storing floating point numbers
			- numbers that may contain decimal places
		- be careful with what numbers you want in you script
			- don't have integers when you need floaters
	- Complex ^complex
		- algebra stuff
		- ```tl_complex = 3.14j```
	- Hexadecimal ^hexadecimal
		- hex numbers
		- ```tl_hex = 0xa```
			- this will spit out 10
		- underlying type is integer, but we've declared it in hexadecimal
	- Octal ^octal
		- octal numbering
		- ```tl_octal = 0o10```
			- this will spit out 8
		- again, underlying type is integer, but we've declared it in octal
- python allows us to print out a numerical value in any way we want
	- ```print(1 + 0x1 + 0o1)
		- that's 1+1+1, so it will print 3
- Several number helper functions
	- abs(number) ^abs
		- absolute value of the number
			- takes the negative off if it has a negative
	- round(number) ^round
		- rounds number up/down
			- .5 will round down
	- bin(number) ^bin
		- binary representation of a number
		- ```bin(8)``` will spit out ```0b1000```
	- hex(number) ^hex
		- hexadecimal
