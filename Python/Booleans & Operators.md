- Booleans ^booleans
	- It's True or False
	- assign a boolean to a variable, then test if it's true or not
	1. `valid = True`
	2. `not_valid = False`
	3. `print(valid == True)`
	4. `print(not_valid == True)`
	- This will spit out
		- `True` because `True` is `True`
		- `False` because `False` is not `True`
	- Can also be compared to numbers
	- `print((10 < 9) == True)`
		- False
	- `print((10 == 10) == True)`
		- True
	- `print((10 != 10) == True)`
		- False
	- `print((10 >= 10) == True)`
		- True
	- `print((10 <= 10) == True)`
		- True
	- `print((10 > 9) == True)`
		- True
	- You can remove the `== True` from all of these and they will work the same.
	- Now let's get complicated
	- `print(10 > 5 and 10 < 5)`
		- Both statements need to be true
		- This would be `False`
	- `print(10 > 5 or 10 < 5)`
		- only one statement needs to be true
		- This would be `True`
- Operators ^operators
	- `==` ^equal
		- equal
	- `!=` ^not-equal
		- not equal
		- Can also replicate with `not`
		- `print(not valid)`
			- spits out `False`
	- `>` ^greater-than
		- Greater than
	- `<` ^less-than
		- Less than
	- `>=` ^greater-than-equal-to
		- Greater than or equal to
	- `<=` ^less-than-equal-to
		- Less than or equal to
	- `and` ^and
		- Both statements needs to be true
	- `or` ^or
		- One of the statements needs to be true
	- `+` ^addition
		- Addition
	- `-` ^subtraction
		- subtraction
	- `/` ^division
		- Division
	- `//` ^rounded-division
		- Division, but it rounds to the nearest whole number
	- `*` ^multiplication
		- Multiplication
	- `**` ^power-of
		- Power of
	- `%` ^remainder
		- Remainder
		- Divides first argument by second argument and returns the remainder
	- `+=`^add-to
		- add to what the variable is equal to
	- `-=` ^subtract-to
		- subtract what the variable is equal to
	- `*=` ^multiply-to
		- multiply what the variable is equal to
	- `/=` ^divide-to
		- divide what the variable is equal to
	- `&`
		- Compares arguments/variables/etc.
		- shorthand for [[Booleans & Operators#^and|and]]
	- `|`
		- compares arguments/variables/etc
		- shorthand for [[Booleans & Operators#^or|or]]
	- 
- Can represent booleans as numbers
	- `bool(0)` is `False`
	- `bool(1)` is `True`
- can evaluate math expressions as well
