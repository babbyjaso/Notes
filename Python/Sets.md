- stores multiple values in one variable
	- `set1 = {"a", "b", "c"}`
	- Looks like a dictionary, but there's no key:value pair
	- sets are not ordered, so each run will give a different sequence of variables
- can't pint indexes of sets because they're in no order
- can't have duplicates either
	- `set2 = {"a", "a", "a"}`
		- prints as `{'a'}`
		- print(len) as `1`
- can be any data type
	- `set3 = {"a", 0, True}`
- can assign using something outside of the curly brackets
	- `set4 = set(("b", 1, False))`
	- you will need the double parenthesis
- can add things using the usual suspects
	- `set1.add("d")`
	- `set3.update(set4)`
	- `set6 = set4.union(set5)`
- because sets can't have duplicates, things will combine
	- we combined `set3` and `set4` into `set3`
		- combined the `0` and `False` into `0`
		- combined the `1` and `True` into `True`
		- this is because they're equal in python's eyes
- can remove things
	- `set4.remove(4)`
	- `set1.pop()`
		- don't recommend this because it's a random order every time.
