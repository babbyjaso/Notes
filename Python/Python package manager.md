- what if we want to perform a function that isn't in the standard library of python3?
- we got existing code packages called modules that we can download!
	- libraries of existing code that we can call after we download it
- `pip` Package manager for python
	- [https://pypi.org]
		- for all your package needs
- as always we gotta install the package before we can use it.
- uninstall with `pip uninstall`
- can see all the packages installed with `pip list`
	- can do a more human readable version with `pip freeze`
- if you get an import error, import the module
- find a module that does the heavy lifting for you then tweak it
