- Single or double quote doesn't matter
	- ```"This is a string"```
	- ```'This is a string too'```
- Three double quotes in a row is for multi-line
	- ```"""this is a multi
	- ```line string"""
- what if you need a string with a quote?
	- use a backslash!
		- backslash escapes the next character
		- ```"I\"m a string"```
		- ```'I\'m a string'```
		- could also use a double quote to define the string and a single quote for the conjunction
	- You can also escape hex characters
		- ```"\x41\x42\x43"```
- Multiple ways to do multiple characters ^mulltiply-string
	- ```string9 = "aaaaaaaaaa"``` or
	- ```string9 = "a" * 10```
	- you can identify the length of a string using ```len(variable)```
- True or false
	- You can find out if there is a certain string in your [[Variables and data types#^variables|variables]] by asking it
		- ```print("string" in string4)```
			- This should spit out ```True``` (in your example at least)
		- ```print("neut" in string4)```
			- This should spit out ```False``` (in your example at least)
- Does it start with _this_ string?
	- ```print(string4.startswith("I"))```
		- This should spit out ```True``` (in your example at least)
	- ```print(string4.startswith("n"))```
		- This should spit out ```False``` (in your example at least)
- Where is this string? ^index
	- ```print(string4.index("string"))```
		- This will return with ```6``` because "string" starts at count 6
- All caps
	- ```print(string4.upper())```
		- makes it all upper case
	- ```print(string4.lower())```
		- makes it all lower case
- Messy strings
	- we got a messy string
		- ```messy_string = "     Messy string!     "```
		- This could cause some issues because when printing this string, all the spaces are in tact
	- strip the string!
		- ```print(messy_string.strip())```
			- spits out ```Messy string!```
	- replace the string!
		- ```print(messy_string.replace("!","?"))```
			- spits out ```     Messy string?     ```
				- Still got the spaces because we didn't strip it in this command as well.
	- strip and replace the string!
		- ```print(messy_string.replace("!","?").strip())```
			- Now we got a clean ```Messy string?```
	- split the string!
		- spits out a [[Variables and data types#^list |list]] of what's in the string
		- ```print(messy_string.split())```
			- defaults to space as the delimiter
			- spits out ```['Messy', 'string!']```
			- can change the delimiter to anything you want
				- ```print(messy_string.split(","))```
					- now you're splitting with a ```,``` as the delimiter
- Encoding strings
	- does what it says, encodes the string
		- ```string4.encode()```
		- defaults to utf-8
	- can specify the code inside of the brackets
- Adjust your string
	- makes your string a certain length
	- ```string4.rjust(25)```
		- will make your string 25 characters
	- customize your delimiter
		- `string4.rjust(25,"X")`
	- Do the same with `string4.ljust()`
- strings are immutable - they cannot be changed once defined ^immutable
	- when python "adds" a string to another, it's just making another string
		- `print("I am " + "a string")` becomes
		- `I am a string` but this is a new string altogether
		- This is called "concatenating"
	- you can only concatenate strings to strings
		- `print("String 4 is " + len(string4) " characters long")` will not work
		- you gotta turn that len function into a string
			- `print("String 4 is " + str(len(string4)) " characters long")`
- sidebar: `+` is an overloaded operator
	- combines numbers and strings without asking
	- all depends on context
- You also don't have to concatenate to get the same result as above
	- `print("String 4 is {} characters long".format(len(string4)))`
		- can avoid syntax errors with this (can't concatenate a function, etc.)
	- placeholders for format are fun
		- `print("{} {} {}".format(len(string4), 5.0, 0x12))`
		- whatever you wanna put in there, as long as you have enough placeholders for it.
	- you can even order them
		- `print("{0} {2} {1}".format(len(string4), 5.0, 0x12))`
		- spits out `14 18 5.0`
	- You can even name them
		- `print("{length}".format(length=len(string4)))`
		- spits out `14`, or `len(string4)`
	- You can even use it to plug in variables
		- "define a literal string variable by prepending an f to the print statement"
		- `length = len(string4)` 
		- `print(f"string4 is {length} characters long")`
			- spits out `string4 is 14 characters long`
			- gotta put that f there to show where the format starts
				- will throw a syntax error if the variable doesn't exist
	- You can still specify how the data is printed
		- `print("string4 is {length} charcters long".format(length=len(string4)))`
		- If you want a float on the number, just put a colon
			- `print("string4 is {length:.2f} charcters long".format(length=len(string4)))`
				- spits out `string4 is 14.00 characters long`
				- increase the number of float places with the number
				- can also represent the number using various other counting methods
					- hex `length:x`
					- binary `length:b`
					- octal `length:o` 
		- great way to sort out data from scraping scripts
