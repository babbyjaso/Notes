- this is for getting information from websites
	- HTTP requests
		- GET
		- PUT
		- HEAD
		- etc.
	- we're gonna use httpbin.org
		- reflects the requests back to us to make sure they work
- `import requests`
	- now get cracking
- have to assign it to a variable
	- `x = requests.get('http://httpbin.org/get')`
- from there we can play with it
	- `print(x.headers)`
		- prints the headers, similar to a curl
	- `print(x.headers['Server'])`
		- specify what part of the headers you wanna look at
	- `print(x.status_code)`
		- prints the status code
		- can use this to verify if something connected successfully:
			- `if x.status_code == 200: print("Success!")`
- would want to know how much time has elapsed from sending to receiving the response
	- `print(x.elapsed)`
- see the cookies
	- `print(x.cookies)`
- see the content
	- `print(x.text)`
- can specify parameters
	- `x = requests.get('http://httpbin.org/get', params={'id':'1'})`
	- `x = requests.get('http://httpbin.org/get?id=1')`
- can specify certain headers
	- `x = requests.get('http://httpbin.org/get', params={'id':'3'}, headers={'Accept':'application/json'})`
- we can upload multi part encoded files
	- `files = {'file': open('google.png', 'rb')}`
	- `x = requests.post('http://httpbin.org/post', files=files)`
	- this will post the request `google.png` in base64
- we can authenticate with basic authentication
	- `x = requests.get('http://httpbin.org/get', auth=('username','password'))`
- we can have failed requests
	- `x = requests.get('https://expired.badssl.com')`
	- and to bypass: `x = requests.get('https://expired.badssl.com', verify=False)`
- by default, it will redirect for all verbs except HEAD
	- you can prevent the redirect by having `allow_redirects=False`
- specify timeout to stop waiting
	- `timeout=0.01`
- all of this has been stateless, so let's carry over some information
	- `x = requests.get('http://httpbin.org/cookies', cookies={'a':'b'})`
	- once we get it, we can specify it in the request
- but we also get sessions!
```
x = requests.Session()
x.cookies.update({'a':'b'})
print(x.get('http://httpbin.org/cookies').text)
```
- we could pass json responses as json
	- `x = requests.get('https://api.github.com/events')`
	- `print(x.json())`
