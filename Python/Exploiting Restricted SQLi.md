- in a blind SQLi, we can sus out a piece of information one at a time
	- database says yes or no for each piece of information
	- this is why loops are so good with it
- what if we only could make 128 queries before we were booted?
	- 32 character MD5 password
	- 16 options per character
	- 128/32 = 4 requests per character
	- not very good with existing tools, but we can make our own script!
- we know the minimum and maximum values
	- 0 and f
- instead of guessing for an unknown value we compare with the middle
	- if less, compare again with a new minimum and maximum from the left
	- if more, compare again with a new minimum and maximum from the right
- this is a binary search

| Query | Alphabet | Question | Result |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| ---<br> | --- | ---<br> | ---<br> |
| 1 | 0123456789abcdef | >7? | False |
| 2 | 01234567 | >3? | True |
| 3 | 34567 | >5? | True |
| 4 | 567 | >6? | False |
- asking if it's greater than the character in the middle to thin it down as we go
