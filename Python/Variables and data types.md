- Variables ^variables
	- a way to store data in named locations
	- reference word
	- allocating space for that data to be stored based on the data type
	- when creating a variable, use an `=`
	- it's whatever you put in
		- string
		- integer
		- etc
	- can re-assign variables at any point
		- define the type of variable with `type(variable)` ^type-variable
	- python supports casting ^casting
		- we can redefine the variable in the middle of the script
		- so if we put a number in quotes, it will be a string
		- but if we put `int("4")` it's now an integer
	- cast must make sense
		- `name = int("neut")` doesn't make sense
		- that's a string of letters not integers
	- Variables are case sensitive
- Data types ^data-types
	- Strings ^strings
		- words in a sequence
	- integers ^integers
		- integral whole numbers
	- [[Lists|Lists]]
		- things in a bracket
		- `["this", "is a", "list", 1]`
		- assigning variables will assign them in sequence
			- `list = ["thing", "stuff", "junk"]`
			- `var1, var2, var3 = list`
			- `var1` is now `"thing"`, etc.
	- [[Tuple|tuple]]
		- used to store multiple items in a single variable
		- uses brackets
	- [[Dictionaries|dictionary]]
		- used to story data in `key:value` pairs
		- uses curly braces `{}`
	- [[Booleans & Operators|booleans]]
		- true or false operator
		- uses T/F
	- range ^range
		- sequence of numbers, starting from 0, increments of 1
			- default settings
		- stops before a specified number
			- ```range(6)``` will stop at 5
				- 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
		- `range(start, stop, step)`
	- [[Sets]]
		- data that's not ordered
