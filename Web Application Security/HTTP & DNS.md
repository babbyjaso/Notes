This will also probably be a refresher
- HTTP
	- request response protocol
	- when you make a request, you need to have a request method
		- GET
			- fetch a resource
		- POST
			- submit data to the server
		- PUT
			- update a resource
		- DELETE
			- remove a resource
	- response codes
		- 1xx = informational
		- 2xx = successful
		- 3xx = redirection
		- 4xx = clent error
		- 5xx = server error
		- this is typical, but you can set your own response code if you want
	- HTTP is stateless
		- each request is treated as a standalone request
		- no memory of any previous requests
			- this is why cookies are used
- DNS
	- Domain Name System
	- hierarchal decentralized naming system for computers, services or any resource that's connected to the internet
	- translate human readable domains to IPs
	- "phonebook for the internet"
	- Top level domains
		- .com
		- .gov
		- .net
		- .org
	- Second level domain
		- the "google" in "google.com"
	- Subdomain
		- the "www" of "www.google.com"
	- DNS Records
		- many different kinds
			- A = IPv4
			- MX = mail server
			- C = creates an alias for the domain
