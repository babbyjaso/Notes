Scope

Out of Scope
	• Refers to the asset that explicitly off-limits for security researching participating in the bug bounty program

Why is this important?
	• Legal and ethical boundaries
		○ Avoid potential conflicts that are legal
	• Resource allocation
		○ Might need time to secure some things
		○ Focus on critical assets first
		○ Budget reasons
	• Practical Reasons

Can you submit Out Of Scope (OOS) bugs?
	• Most of the time
		○ It's bad because it'll give you negative karma on the board too
	• They can still be made aware if there's a business impact
		○ No bounty, but you get karma usually
Duplicate bugs
	• Multiple researchers report the same bug
		○ First one gets the award
	• Knowingly reporting duplicate report is unethical
Structural issues
	• One fix, one reward
	• If multiple fixes are required, it is not a duplicate
		○ Ex: two endpoints have the same vunl, it would be two reports because it's two endpoints
	• Think about if one fix will fix the others
		○ Same fix applied to two endpoints, that is a duplicate
