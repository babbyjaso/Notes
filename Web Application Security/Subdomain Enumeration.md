Subdomains exist, you should enumerate them.
- web browser
	- "site:website.com"
		- this will give you some starts
		- basically OSINT your website
			- see what's publicly available by the scanners
	- crt.sh ^crt-sh
		- certificate search
			- search using "%.website.com"
			- % wildcard because it's a database
- CLI tools
	- subfinder ^subfinder
		- -d for domain
		- -o to write to a file to grep later
	- assetfinder ^assetfinder
		- just put in your domain
	- amass ^amass
		- you should try out amass, because it seems interesting.
	- httprobe
		- you can use this to find out what subdomains are alive
	- gowitness
		- give it a file and take screenshots
		- options
			- -f = directory file
			- -P = where to put the screenshots
			- --no-http = little self explanatory
		- this also makes sure that it's alive
