yay burp!
i love burp it's so cool
- you're gonna have to set up your proxy listener so that the traffic routes through Burp
	- foxy proxy
		- route to 127.0.0.1
		- port 8080
		- check it's going through burp with "http://burp"
	- getting the certificate to have it be legitimate.
		- on the burp check, download the CA Certificate
		- settings > privacy and security > View Certificates...
			- import a certificate
			- put in the one you just downloaded
		- be sure to trust the certificate
		- now it won't be bugging you when you turn on intercept
- Target tab
	- tracks everything that's going out
	- navigating to your website will also show what technologies probably because of api stuff
	- we can create scopes to not send
		- this will give us a filter that target will follow
		- Heath likes "advance scope control"
			- this will give us more host and IP range with any protocol
			- so we get all the subdomains as well as the top domain
	- go in, click around, see what comes up on the target tab for burp
		- what is this website and why is it working this way?
		- Business Logic ^business-logic
- Proxy tab
	- we can also filter by scope
		- don't wanna be hasty, because we wanna get a lay of the land
		- What is normal?
- Repeater
	- you can forward requests to the repeater which repeats request, which you can make small tweaks with each request
- Intruder
	- attack times!
	- start up intercept and then send it to intruder
	- will give you a dropdown of attack types for the website
	- this is how you can brute force a login if you can
	- go check out the attack type dropdown
	- can grep results that you get back from a wordlist from and intruder attack
- Decoder
	- Can encode or decode to make it easier to paste your requests
- Comparer
	- Compares whatever you paste in the two boxes
- Extensions
	- community extensions!
	- Heath recommends Logger++
- Pro addition:
	- passive vuln scanning
	- crawling
