- Will probably be review, but let's go over some stuff
- HTML
	- standard markup to create web pages
	- text with tags
- Cascade sheets
	- styling for HTML
	- can do css injection but unlikely
- javascript
	- here's where the meat is
	- you need to understand javascript if you wanna be a web pentester
- Client vs server
	- Server
		- where the website is hosted
		- operations where the application is hosted
			- data storage/retreiveal
			- processing
	- Client
		- operations on the end user's device
			- presenting data to the user
			- user interactions
- There will be other technologies, but we'll cover them later
	- CDN
	- Web application firewalls
	- Load balances
- Traditional vs Modern web apps
	- Traditional
		- usually require a full page reload
		- returns complete HTML page
	- Modern
		- loading data in the background
		- updates portions of the page, not the whole page
