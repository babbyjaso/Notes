You probably know all of this already, because of eJPT
But let's go over it again anyway

Engagement Steps
	• SOW and MSA signed
		○ SOW = Scope Of Work
			§ "here's what we're doing"
		○ MSA = Master Service Agreement
			§ Overall liability agreement
			§ Legal rules
	• ROE Signed
		○ Rules Of Engagement
		○ What you can and cannot do
			§ Times
			§ Dates
			§ IPs
			§ Etc.
	• Scope verified
		○ Everything is spelled out about what will happen in the test in this document
		○ Out of Scope is also very important
			§ What you will not do
				□ Typically DoS or Phishing/Social Engineering
	• Pentest occurs
		○ DO NOT do this until the SOW is signed
		○ Typically last a week
	• Report written & delivered
		○ For the Customer's reading
	• Client debrief
		○ For the customer's presenting
	• Retesting (as necessary)
		○ Remediated problems if they need it
