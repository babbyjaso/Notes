- "A thread is an executable unit employed by a process and scheduled based on device factors."
	- Here are some of those factors
		- CPU
		- Memory specifications
		- Priority
		- Logical factors
		- etc.
- Basically, controls the execution of a process
	- because they control execution, it's targeted
	- if you control when and what is executed, injection is trivial
	- or get API calls to remote in to get other instructions
- Threads share details with the process
- Unique values for threads
	- Stack
		- relevant and specific data of the thread
	- Thread Local Storage
		- pointers for unique data
	- Stack Argument
		- Thread's unique ID
		- You'll have multiple threads (multiple things need to happen in a process) so you'll get multiple IDs
		- Allows passing of data between threads
	- Context Structure
		- Stores where the thread is to the kernel
- Can filter out threads created in [[ProcMon]]
