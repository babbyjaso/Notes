- What make the program do
- Application != Process
	- applications trigger processes
	- usually has multiple processes executed to work
- [There's a whole docs page about processes and threads](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/procthread/about-processes-and-threads)
- Process has
	- [[Virtual Memory|Virtual address space]]
		- memory addresses for the process
	- executable code
		- code in those memory addresses
	- open handles to system objects
		- [a number that is defined to tell system resources what that process is](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/procthread/process-handles-and-identifiers)
		- not a PID, but close to it
	- security context
		- access token that grants it authorizations if it needs them
	- unique process identifier
		- unique number of the process
	- environment variables
	- priority class
	- minimum and maximum working set sizes
	- [at least one thread of execution](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/procthread/creating-threads)
		- [[Threads]]
		- section of a process scheduled for execution
		- can have multiple executions, thus multiple threads
- Default applications that start processes
	- MsMpEng (MSDef)
	- wininit (human interaction device)
	- lsass (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service)
		- Security process
- If you're targeting persistence, you want a fake process running
	- Injection or Masquerading
