- Windows has a lot of internal components that need to interact with the physical hardware and/or memory
- The [kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(operating_system)) bridges this this and controls those operations
- Applications typically can't interact with the kernel or modify physical hardware, so they made different modes to access this hardware:
	- User mode
		- Can't directly access hardware
		- creates a process in virtual address space
		- access to shared physical memory
	- Kernel mode
		- can directly access hardware
		- runs in a single shared virtual address
		- access to all of the system memory
- Switching between these is typically controlled by the system and API calls
	- sometimes referred to as the "switching point"
- When applications are started in user mode, they will stay there until a system and/or API call is made.
	- APIs interface with the system, so that's the call

- after this call is made, the application switches to kernel mode
- because of this, we can edit code to inject any process we want
	- as long as we have the code
