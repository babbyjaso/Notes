- compression or encryption to make a piece of malware look different than it's original source
	- we're compressing the program basically
- how it works
	- Place in the code called a "compression stub"
	- Everything below this is gonna get the hydraulic press
	- once the code is being run, the stub is seen so everything is getting uncompressed
- Why do this?
	- AV evasion
		- doesn't have the same signatures as the original malicious file
- Seeing this in [[PEview]]
	- You'll see the section "SECTION UPX"
		- means this was packed by the program UPX
		- other programs: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_compression#Portable_Executable)
	- This can change the Address Table
		- This example is smaller, but we see two calls:
			- [GetProcAddress](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/libloaderapi/nf-libloaderapi-getprocaddress)
				- "Retrieves the address of an exported function (also known as a procedure) or variable from the specified dynamic-link library (DLL)."
			- [LoadLibaryA](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/libloaderapi/nf-libloaderapi-loadlibrarya)
				- "Loads the specified module into the address space of the calling process. The specified module may cause other modules to be loaded."
		- Using this example, we can look for any DLLs in the Address Table to see what it's loading from
