- Basic analysis ^static-bas
	- Using tools to look at the malware without executing it
		- get hashes
		- look at any [[PEview#^win-api|Windows API calls]]
		- look at any [[Strings]] in the malware
		- look at the size of the malware to see if it's [[Packed Malware|packed]] or not
	- tools to do this:
		- [[Strings]]
		- [[PEview]]
		- [[PEstudio]]
		- [[FLOSS]]
- Advanced analysis ^static-adv
	- Uses
		- Decompilers
		- Disassemblers
	- Tools:
		- [[Cutter]]
	- Looking at the [[Assembly|assembly instructions]] of the malware (ASM)
		- Human readable CPU instruction set
		- CPU deals in binary, ASM is the pattern of binary put to somewhat human readable language
	- Compiler takes the human stuff (`print(hello world)`) and turns it into binary
	- Several things have to be present for a binary to execute:
		- CPU instructions
			- Arithmetic instructions
				- `sub`, etc.
			- Data movement instructions
				- `mov`, `jnz`, `jmp`, `jne`, etc
			- Control flow instructions
				- `push`, `pop`, `call`, `ret` etc.
					- [[Cutter]] is super nice and will show us what/where is being manipulated
		- Memory registers ^stat-mem
			- holds and handles data at runtime
				- ex: reading a tape
			- `eax`, `edx`, `ebx`, `esp`, `ebp`, etc.
		- Stack ^stat-stack
			- stack grows downward
			- finds a place in memory and starts from zero and moves down
			- LIFO
				- Last In First Out
				- reads from the bottom up
	- Process Injection
		- program that will take a legitimate process and inject some kind of code into it
			- example here takes an argument in the code
				- in this case shell codea
			- passes this argument into a process
				- werfault.exe
			- then tells it to write the code to memory inside of the process
				- making room in the process memory for the code
			- then opens the remote thread
				- legit werfault.exe opened, but it's got a shell inside of it
		- This does start the process as the child process of the malicious program
			- after the `CreateRemoteThread` it becomes its own parent
			- lots of EDR solutions watch for `CreateRemoteThread` so this is also rookie hours
