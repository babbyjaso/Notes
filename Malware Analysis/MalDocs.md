- They're so useful (for attackers)
- You're looking for the "m" part of the file
	- `.docm`
	- `.xlsm`
	- `.pptm`

- Because we don't have office in Flare, we can't do [[Dynamic Analysis]]
	- only [[Static Analysis]] for us
- But, we will be in Remnux
- Once over in Remnux we...unzip the sheet?
	- `.xlsm` files are just like big containers for the data inside
	- `unzip` command to inflate all the contained data
	- instantly, we see a `vbaProject.bin` which is interesting
		- VBA being Visual BAsic, so a script
		- `.bin` being a binary, so we'll see raw bytes somewhere
	- we can just straight up `cat` it
		- see some strings, but not much else
- We need a tool: [[oledump.py]]
	- oledump is also on FlareVM
- same with the docm/x version
	- a macro is a macro is a macro
- .docm files are just as unsafe
- Word file templates can have a link to an external address to download something
	- you can find this in the rels directory
	- it is a .rels file
