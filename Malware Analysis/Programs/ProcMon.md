	- sysinternals GOATED
	- tells you what processes are doing at any point
	- thankfully you can filter
- Filtering
	- we can initially set what the name of the process is to watch it and what it does when we launch it
		- `Process Name is [malware name]`
	- Operation is a good column to watch
		- tells you what the process is doing
	- Detail column
		- a bit self explanatory, but a good column to watch
	- Path Filter
		- Got a string from static analysis? throw it in
	- Parent PID
		- can monitor things that are spawning from your malware
- Process Tree ^process-tree
	- this will show you all the processes and their child processes
		- extremely useful for finding your malicious process and whatever it's spawning
		- First malware example has the cmd running under the RAT program, but this is amateur hour stuff
			- more sophisticated malware will spawn it under other processes
