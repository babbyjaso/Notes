- way to look at an executable
	- broken down into sections on the left dropdowns
- Raw Data
	- pFile is where the binary is in relation to the beginning of the program
	- Raw Data is the bytes in Hex
	- Value is the ASCII value of these bytes
	- All starts with a byte that tells what kind of file it is ^first-byte
- IMAGE_FILE_HEADER
	- Under "IMAGE_NT_HEATERD"
	- will tell you when it was compiled
- IMAGE_SECTION_HEAER .text
	- tells you the size of the executable
	- both in size on disk (Virtual Size) and size of the binary (Size of Raw Data)
		- if your Raw Data is a lot less than the Virtual size, it's probably packed
- IMPORT Address Table
	- Under SECTION .rdata
	- interacts with the [[Windows API]]
		- Windows API being functions that the OS offers that other programs can make use of
		- ex: "DownloadURL"

		- now you can use it, you just have to import it
	- we can see what the executable is calling and take some guesses as to what it's doing.
		- don't know what something does? check the docs MS provides
	- some hits to check
