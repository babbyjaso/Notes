- OLE is a class of embedding features in Office documents
	- can put a word doc in your powerpoint
- we can abuse the heck out of it, but we can use oledump to carve out what we want
	- assigns indexes for what it finds
	- puts a `M` next to the data streams that it finds macros
- `oledump.py -s 3 sheetsForFinancial.xlsm`
	- target stream 3 of the file "sheetsForFinancial.xlsm"
	- gives the hex dump of this bin
	- pump this into strings?
		- We can already do this by adding a `-S`
		- does a string dump
	- we can also see how the VB script is written with `--vbadecompresscorroupt`
		- will give us the full text of the macro in the worksheet
