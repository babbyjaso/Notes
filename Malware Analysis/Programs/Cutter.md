- A disassembler
	- used in [[Static Analysis#^static-adv|advanced static analysis]]
- Dashboard tab
	- Has lots of relevant and familiar information
		- architecture
		- language
		- hashes
- Functions column
	- on the left
	- is every function that is called in the entire program
	- primarily looking for "main"
		- main is where everything runs from
	- `dbg.` are debug symbols
		- its for printing errors
- Disassembly tab
	- shows the [[Assembly|assembly language]] of the program
	- can also see some of the [[Strings]] that we found during the [[Static Analysis#^static-bas|basic static analysis]]
	- can get here from Strings tab by right clicking as well
- Graph tab
	- Lays out the flow of the ASM
	- if something is pushed to the memory, you can double click the memory location to go to it
		- `0x...` is the memory location
- Decompiler tab
	- Recreates the source code as best as possible
		- it knows the language it was written in and the ASM
		- works backwards from there
	- tip
		- see if you can find some of the [[Strings]] in the code
		- all intents and purposes, you should be able to
- Strings tab
	- you can see all the strings here
	- also can search at the bottom
	- will show where the string is under the section column
	- hover over a string and hit the `X` key to bring up where it's cross referenced
- Hexdump tab
	- the raw data in hexidecimal
	- we can edit the bytes here
- We can edit binaries
	- Find a part that you want to edit
	- Right click > Edit
	- typically used to reverse jumps, because that's where we can pivot the malware
		- remember to satisfy all the previous conditions to get to the jump in the first place
