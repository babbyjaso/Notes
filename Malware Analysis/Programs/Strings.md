- String is an array of characters
- Also the name of a tool
- Computer has to be told what to do
	- with this, we can use this array of characters to maybe get a glimpse into what it's doing
	- with this we use Stings
- So about that tool "Strings"
	- it just finds strings in the executable
	- that's it
	- but there's something better: [[FLOSS]]
