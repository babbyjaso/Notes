- Binary talks to CPU
- We assign binary to sets of 8 into a hex digit, called a byte
	- 4 x 4
	- ex: 10100101
		- 1010 = A
		- 0101 = 5
		- Hex number: A5
			- written `0xA5`
- among these hex numbers are opcodes and operands
- Opcodes
	- Numbers that correspond to instructions performed by the CPU
	- ex: `040000:    b8 5f 00 00 00    mov eax, 0x5f`
		- This instruction is `mov eax, 0x5f`
		- `040000:` is where the instruction is located
		- `b8` is the instruction `mov eax`
		- `5f 00 00 00` is the operand `0x5f`
			- because of [endianness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness) it has multiple bytes
			- This is the big-endianness notation
				- most significant byte at the smallest memory address
				- reads left to right
			- little-endianess notation: `00 00 00 5f`
				- Flip of BE
				- dominant ordering for x86 architectures

	- Three types of operands
		- Immediate operands
			- constants and/or fixed values
			- eg: `0x5f`
		- Registers
			- eg: `eax`
			- where immediate operands are stored
		- Memory operands
			- denoted by square brackets
			- references memory locations
			- eg: `[eax]`
				- the value in `eax` is the memory location where the operation has to be performed
