Got a list of targets? put them in a text file and target them with Impacket
- `ntlmrelayx.py`
	- to target a file, put `-tf`
		- this file must have all the target IPs in it
	- target `-t`
		- just put the IP or username
- [[SMB Relay]]
	- once you check that an [[SMB Relay]] attack is viable, be sure to turn off HTTP and SMB from [[Responder]] so Impacket isn't fighting over ports
	- `-smb2support`
	- This is also a way to get SAM hashes
		- You should probably copy the hash
	- Have a few options as well with this
		- `-i` for interactive session
			- will create a shell on the target
			- just have to fire up your `nc` to bind to the home port it puts it on
		- `-c` to enter a command
			- wrap the command in double quotes
