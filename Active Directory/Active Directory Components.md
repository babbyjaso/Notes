Two types of components for Active Directory
- Physical
	- Data Store
		- Consists of the Ntds.dit file
			- has all your hashes and passwords
		- Is stored by default in the %SystemRoot%\NTDS folder on all domain controllers
		- Is accessible only through the domain controller process and protocols
	- Domain controllers
		- Hosts a copy of the AD DS directory store
		- Provide authentication and authorization services
		- Replicate updates to other domain controllers in the domain and forest
		- Allow administrative access to manage user accounts and network resources
	- Global catalog server
	- Read-Only Domain Controller (RODC)
- Logical
	- Partitions
	- Schema
		- Defines every type of object that can be stored in the directory
		- Enforces rules regarding object creation and configuration
		- two types of objects:
			- Class Object
				- Objects can be created in the directory
				- ex: Users, computers
			- Attribute Object
				- Information that can be attacked to an object
				- ex: Display name
	- Domains
		- Groups and manages objects in an organization
		- An administrative boundary for applying policies to groups of objects
		- A replication boundary for replicating data between domain controllers
		- An authentication and authorization boundary that provides a way to limit the scope of access to resources
	- Domain trees
		- Hierarchy of domains in AD DS
		- Shares a contiguous namespace with the parent domain
			- ex: the main domain is "contoso.com" while the trees will be "na.contoso.com" or "uk.contoso.com"
		- Can have additional child domains
			- the children are the "na.contoso.com" to the parent of "contoso.com"
		- By default creates a two-way transitive trust with other domains
	- Forests
		- Collection of Domain trees
		- Shares a lot of things over the domains
			- schema
			- configuration partition
			- global catalog
		- enables trusts between all domains in the forest
		- Share enterprise admin and schema admin groups
	- Sites
	- Organization units (OUs)
		- AD containers that can have users, groups, computers or other OUs
		- Gives the ability to manage a collection of objects in a consistent way
			- permissions
			- policies
			- etc.
	- Trusts
		- Mechanism for users to gain access to resources in another domain
			- all domains in a forest trust all other domains in the forest
			- trusts can extend to outside the forest
		- two types:
		- Directional
			- flows from the trusting domain to the trusted domain
		- Transitive
			- includes other trusted domains
	- Objects
		- Things in the Domain
			- Users
			- Groups
			- Computers
			- Printers
			- Shared Folders
