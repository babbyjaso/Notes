### Mobile Vulnerabilities
- Bring your own device (BYOD)
	- security policy set by a company that allows employees to user their personal smartphones, laptops, and tablets for work and connection to the corporate network
	- could be anything from mice/keyboard to laptops/tablets
	- lots of challenges with this:
		- deperimeterization
			- expands the perimeter of the office to the home
		- unpatched and unsecured devices
		- strained infrastructure
			- more people = more network load
		- forensic complications
			- can’t make them give up their device
		- lost or stolen devices
			- whoops
- there are specific threats and vulnerabilities with mobile platforms
- android
	- linux based OS by google
	- largest market share
	- larger number of older devices
	- open nature of the OS
	- usage of third-party apps
- iOS
	- only run on iPhones
	- people like to jailbreak iPhone, the largest threat vector used by attackers
	- apple devices are a show of wealth, making it prime for attacks
	- zero-day exploits for iPhones are used by nation state actors and APTs against high value targets
- Mobile Device Management (MDM)
	- process and supporting technologies for track,controlling, and securing the organization’s mobile infrastructure
	- can also use Enterprise Mobile Management (EMM)
		- mobile device management suite with broader capabilities, such as identity and application management.
	- some features;
		- device enrollment and authentication
		- remote lock and remote wipe
		- identifying device locations
		- patch and update deployments
		- preventing root/jailbreaks
		- Encrypted containers for data
			- container for sensitive data, not your angry birds
		- Restricting features/services
	- you can use MDM/EMM to manage incidents and conduct investigations
### IoT Vulnerabilities
- Internet of Things
	- group of objects that are connected to the wider internet by using embedded electronic components
	- smart stuff
- it’s not all secure!!!
- most smart devices use an embedded version of linux or android as their OS
- devices must be secured and updated when new vulnerabilities are found
- IoT developers don’t think about security
- segment them into their own network
### Embedded System Vulnerabilities
- Embedded Systems
	- a computer system that is designed to perform a specific, dedicated function
- IoT stuff got OSes too.
- lesson will focus on specific function items
- embedded systems are considered static environments where frequent changes are not made or allowed
- embedded systems have very little support for identifying and correcting security issues
- you want them on their own separate network
- Programmable Logic Controller (PLC)
	- a type of computer designed for deployment in an industrial or outdoor setting that can automate and monitor mechanical systems
	- runs on firmware, which can be patched and reprogrammed to fix vulnerabilities
	- infrequent tho
- [[Mitigate Software Vulnerabilities and Attacks#^soc|System-on-Chip (SoC)]] ^soc
	- processor that integrates the platform functionality of multiple logical controllers onto a single chip
	- power efficient and used with embedded systems, because it’s a single chip.
- Real-Time Operating System (RTOS)
	- a type of OS that prioritizes deterministic execution of operations to ensure consistent response for time-critical tasks
	- embedded systems typically cannot tolerate reboots or crashes and must have response times that are predictable to within microsecond tolerances
- [[Hardware Assurance Best Practices#^anti-tamper|Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)]]
	- processor that can be programmed to perform a specific function by a customer rather than at the time of manufacture
	- end customer can configure the programming logic to run a specific application instead of using an ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit)
### ICS & SCADA Vulnerabilities
- a lot of embedded systems will be put into an ICS or SCADA network
- Operational Technology (OT)
	- communications network designed to implement an industrial control system rather than data networking
	- technology that affects physical things.
		- open/shut valve, etc
	- these computers just do this one thing and typically are isolated.
	- can still have windows machines talk to them
	- industrial systems prioritize availability and integrity over confidentiality
		- who cares about who does it, as long as it always can be done
- ICS
	- Industrial Control System
	- A network that manages embedded systems
	- used for electrical power stations, water suppliers, health services, telecommunications, manufacturing and defense needs
	- here’s a thing ICS uses: Fieldbus
		- Digital serial data communications used in operational technology networks to link PLCs
		- PLC is the thing that tells the physical thing what to do
	- Human-Machine Interface (HMI)
		- input and output controls on a PLC to allow a user to configure and monitor the system
		- the way that you push button to open valve
	- ICS manages the process automation by linking together PLCs using a fieldbus to make changes in the physical world
	- use HMI to see what happened and make informed decisions on what to do next
	- so, how do we log this? Data Historian
	- software that aggregates and catalogs data from multiple sources within an industrial control system
- SCADA
	- Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition
	- Type of industrial control system that manages large-scale, multiple-site devices and equipment spread over geographic region
	- ICS = one plant, SCADA = multiple plants
	- typically run as software on ordinary computers to gather data from and managed plant devices and equipment with embedded PLCs
- Modbus
	- communications protocol used in operational technology networks
	- the TCP/IP of OT networks
	- gives control servers and SCADA hosts the ability to query and change the configuration of each PLC
	- it’s NOT TCP/IP, different everything almost
### Mitigating Vulnerabilities
- so now, how to keep vulnerabilities out of your ICS/SCADA system?
- NIST 800-82
- four key controls for mitigating vulnerabilities in specialized systems
	- establish administrative control over OT networks by recruiting staff with relevant expertise
		- ICS/SCADA is a different beast
	- implement the minimum network links by disabling unnecessary links, services, and protocols
		- least permissions, etc
	- Develop and test a patch management program for OT networks
	- perform regular audits of logical and physical access to systems to detect possible vulnerabilities and intrusions
	- WARNING: enumeration tools and vuln scans can cause problems on OT networks
		- wireshark to capture packets to do passive analysis
### Premise System Vulnerabilities
- wtf is a premise system
- systems used for building automation and physical access security
	- many system designs allow the monitoring to be accessible from the corporate data network or even directly from the internet
- Building Automation System (BAS)
	- components and protocols that facilitate the centralized configuration and monitoring of mechanical and electrical systems within offices and data centers
	- not an ICS/SCADA for it, but the step after that.
	- turn on and off stuff on a specific floor
	- put in their own network
- things to keep in mind for a BAS
	- process and memory vulnerabilities in PLC
	- plaintext credentials or keys in application code
	- code injection via web user interface
- can create a DoS condition by affecting building automation systems like HVAC
	- holy shit you can take away A/C to do an attack
- Physical Access Control System (PACS)
	- components and protocols that facilitate the centralized configuration and monitoring of security mechanisms within offices and data centers 
	- can be implemented as part of your BAS or a separate system
	- WARNING: often installed and maintained by an external supplier and therefore omitted from risk and club assessments by analysts.
### Vehicular Vulnerabilities
- Teslas can drive themselves lol
- vehicles connect numerous subsystems over a controller area network (CAN)
	- digital serial data communications network used within vehicles
- the primary external interface is the Onboard Diagnostics (OBD-II) module
	- you use this for cars!!!!
	- needed something to check why the check engine light is on.
- CAN bus acts like a ethernet, all trust
- our cars are basically an IoT machine
- No concept of source addressing or message authentication in a CAN bus
- ways to get to the CAN bus:
	- attach the exploit to OBD-II
	- exploit over onboard cellular
	- exploit over onboard Wi-Fi
