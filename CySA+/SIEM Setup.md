- Splunk
	- very good at connecting a lot of data systems
    - local or cloud-based
- ELK
	- Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana, and Beats
    - We went over this in the bootcamp
- ArcSight
	- compliance reporting
- QRadar
	- IBM’s flavor SIEM
- AlienVault (!!) and OSSIM
	- OSSIM can integrate other open-source tools to have an integrated web admin tool to manage the whole environment.
- Graylog
	- more for IT and NOC operations
- Intel loses value over time
	-  everything needs to be current and relevant.
-  Intelligence process that SIEM relates to
	- Collection & Processing
	- Analysis
	- Dissemination
    - SIEMs are good, because you can automate things
 - Now you gotta figure out what you want to collect
    - Configure SIEM to focus on events you need to know
- Use cases
    - Data sources with indicators
    - query strings used to correlate indicators
    - actions to occur when event is triggered
    - all of this makes the bad thing
    - make sure it captures the 5 W’s (Who, What, Where, When, Where)
- Data Normalization ^data-normalization
    - security data comes from numerous places
    - gotta normalize it
	    - process where data is reformatted or restructure to facilitate the scanning and analysis process
    - agent-based data
	    - agent service installed on each host to log, filter, aggregate, and normalize data before sending it to the SIEM
	    - endpoint does the work
    - Listener/Collectors
	    - host that pushes updates to the SIEM via syslog or SNMP
    - Sensors
	    - SIEM can collect packet capture and traffic flow from sniffers and sensors
    - With all this data, we need to parse and normalize
	    - Parsing: make it all in the same language
	    - Normalize: [[SIEM Setup#^data-normalization]]
	    - typically done with Connectors or Plug-ins
    - use a standard format for all time across things that happen
    - Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)
	    - a time standard, not a time zone
    - when storing log data, make sure you have the CIA triangle is in mind
	    - hashes for integrity
- Event logs ^event-log
    - logs on your machine
    - Windows logs
	    - Application
		    - Events generated by applications and services
		    - eg. printer service
	    - Security
		    - Audit events like failed log-on or access denial
	    - System
		    - events generated by the OS and services
		    - windows errors
		    - storage volume health check
	    - Setup
		    - generated during installation of windows
	    - Forward Events
		    - events that are sent to local from other computers
	    - Severity
		    - Information
		    - Warning
		    - Error
		    - Audit Success/Failure
	    - Event logs provide as much information as possible
	    - Forwarded Events deep
		    - forwards all events to a single host that allows for bigger view of network events using XML
- Syslog ^syslog
    - it’s linux
    - most OS and networking equipment
    - port 514 UDP
    - newer implementations use 1468 TCP for assured delivery
    - newer implementations use TLS to encrypt messages
    - newer implementations use MD5 and SHA1
    - and some more others
    - called syslog-ng
    - syslog can refer to the protocol, the server or the logs themselves
