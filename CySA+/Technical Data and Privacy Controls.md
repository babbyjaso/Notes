- For more managerial controls: [[Non-technical Data and Privacy Controls]]
### Access Controls
- access control model can be applied to data or software resource
	- file system
	- network
	- database
- Uses ACLs
	- each record in an ACL is an access control entry (ACE)
- Database security allows for a more fine-grained permission configuration
	- based on columns and actions
- geographic access requirements
- storage locations should consider data sovereignty issues
	- employees may need access from multiple geographic locations
### File System Permissions
- incorrect permissions allocated to a resource can cause a data breach
- Windows
	- icacls
		- command line tool for showing and modifying file permissions
			- N - No access
			- F - Full access
			- R - Read-only
			- RX - read and execute
			- M - modify
			- W - write
			- D - delete
	- a comma-separated list of permissions is used for complex permissions
- Linux
	- everything is treated as a file within Linux
	- just three permissions (kinda)
		- `r` - Read
			- the ability to access and view the contents of a file or list the contents of a directory
		- `w` - Write
			- the ability to save changes to a file, or create, rename and delete files in a directory
			- need execute to delete a file
		- `x` - Execute
			- the ability to run a script, program, or other software file, or the ability to access a directory, execute a file from that directory, or perform a task on that directory
	- Owner permissions
		- these permissions determine what the file’s owner can do with the file
	- Group permissions
		- these permissions determine what members of the file’s group who are not the owner can do with it
	- World or Other Permissions
		- these permissions determine what users who are not the file’s owner or members of its group can do with the file
	- always in that order on linux
	- there’s also numbers to assign permissions
	- ![[permissions venn diagram.png]]]
	- `chmod` to modify permissions
		- `chmod g+x, o-r home`
			- for file/directory home, add execute to the group, remove read from other
		- `chmod u=rwx,g=rw,o=rx home`
			- assigning permissions to different groups
		- `chmod 755 home`
			- owner has all permissions, group and other have read execute
	- `chown`
		- changes owner of the file
### Encryption
- not a full review of all encryption
- concepts of encryption
- used to secure information for different data states
- encryption is a form of risk mitigation for access controls
- Data at rest ^data-at-rest
	- inactive data that is stored physically in any digital form
	- protected by disk, database file or folder encryption
- Data in motion ^data-in-motion
	- data that is actively being transmitted over a network
	- protected by transport encryption protocols
		- IPSec
		- TLS
		- WPA2
- Data in Use ^data-in-use
	- active data which is stored in a non-persistent digital state
	- usually in RAM, CPU caches or CPU registers
	- protected by secure processing mechanisms
		- hardware security and root of trust
### Data Loss Prevention
- a software solution that detects and prevents sensitive information from being stored on unauthorized systems or transmitted over unauthorized networks
- main components
	- policy server
	- endpoint agents
	- network agents
- DLP agents can scan both structured and unstructured formats
- the transfer of content can then be blocked if it does not conform to a predefined policy
- DLP systems act when a policy violation is detected
- Will do one of four actions:
	- alert only
	- block
	- quarantine
	- tombstone
		- the original file is quarantined and replaced with a policy violation file
- DLP remediation can occur using client-side or server-side mechanisms
### DLP Discovery and Classification
- different mechanisms for detection
- Classification
	- rule based on confidentiality classification tag or label attached to the data
- Dictionary
	- set of patterns that should be matched
- Policy Template
	- template contains dictionaries optimized for data points in a regulatory or legislative schema
	- matches text formats
- Exact Data Match (EDM)
	- structured database of string values to match
	- searches with hashed values
- Document Matching
	- matching based on an entire or partial document based on hashes
- Statistical/Lexicon
	- further refinement of partial document matching to use machine learning to analyze a range of data sources
### Deidentification Controls
- Deidentification
	- methods and technologies that remove identifying information from data before it is distributed
- deidentification is often implemented as part of database design
- Data Masking
	- deidentification method where generic or placeholder labels are substituted for real data while preserving the structure or format of the original data
	- covering up the data, basically
- Tokenization
	- deidentification method where a unique token is substituted for real data
	- be careful if it’s reversible, or able to be looked up
- Aggregation/Banding
	- deidentification technique where data is generalized to protect the individuals involved
	- “out of the x that participated, y had”
- Reidentification
	- an attack that combines a deidentified dataset with other data sources to discover how secure the deidentification method used is.
### DRM and Watermarking
- source your art
- Digital Rights Management (DRM)
	- copyright protection technologies for digital media which attempts to mitigate the risk of unauthorized copies being distributed
- DRM can be implemented using hardware or software approaches
- Watermarking
	- methods and technologies that apply a unique anti-tamper signature or message to a copy of a document
- Forensic Watermark
	- a digital watermark that can defeat attempts at removal by cropping pages or images in the file
