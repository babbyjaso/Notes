### Scan Reports
- a lot are color coded for severity
- previous scan reports can be viewed through the dashboard
- manual distribution of reports can allow better control over the contents and lets analysts explain the results
### Common Identifiers
- different scanning tools can identify the same vulnerabilities and platforms consistently
- 6 main things we use to identify them
	- CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
		- Commonly used scheme for identifying vulnerabilities developed by MITRE and adopted by NIST
		- nomenclature: CVE-YYYY-####
	- NVD (National Vulnerability Database)
		- superset of the CVE database, maintained by NIST, that contains additional information such as analysis, criticality metrics (CVSS) and fix information and instructions
	- CWE 
	- CAPEC (Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification)
		- knowledge base maintained by MITRE that classifies specific attack patterns focused on application security and exploit techniques
		- it’s not ATT&CK, which is a tool for TTPs in network intrusion
			- technical details, not personal details
	- CPE (Common Platform Enumeration)
		- scheme for identifying hardware decies, operating systems, and applications
		- nomenclature: cpe:/{part}:{vendor}:{product}:{version}:{update}:{edition}:{language}
	- CCE (Common COnfiguration Enumeration)
		- a collection of configuration best-practice statements
### CVSS
- Common Vulnerability Scoring System
	- risk management approach to quantifying vulnerability data and then taking into account the degree of risk to different types of systems or information
- can be useful in prioritizing response actions
- base form: score with a description
- three things added into the metric:
	- Base metrics
		- Access Vector (AV)
			- Physical, Local, Adjacent, or Network
		- Access Complexity (AC)
			- High or Low
		- Privileges Required (PR)
			- None, Low, or High
		- User Interaction (UI)
			- None or Required
		- Scope (S)
			- Unchanged or Changed
			- change is more risk
		- Confidentiality (C)
			- High, Medium or Low
		- Integrity (I)
			- High, Medium or Low
		- Availability (A)
			- High, Medium, or Low
	- Temporal metrics
		- composed of Exploit Code Maturity, Remediation Level, and Report Confidence
	- environmental metrics
		- composed of modified base metrics
- CVSS Metrics are helpful, but don’t rely exclusively on them
	- we’re still an analyst, we’re paid to think.
- Multiple versions of CVSS, current is 3.1
	- you can calculate your own CVSS at first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1
### Vulnerability Reports
- A vulnerability report that is not validated is useless
	- we gotta look through it to make sure it’s accurate
- Seperated into the 4 categories:
	- True Positive
		- bad thing that does exist
	- False Positive
		- bad thing that does not exist
	- True Negative
		- good thing that does exist
	- False Negative
		- good thing that does not exist
- How to keep False Negatives out of your life:
	- Repeated Scans
	- Different scan types
	- different sensitivities
	- different scanner
- auto crafted report, now it’s time to validate it
	- Reconcile Results
		- scanners can misinterpret information
	- Correlate the scan results with other data sources
		- review related system and network logs
	- compare results to best practices
		- determines if they are high priority or low risk
	- identify exceptions
		- work around risks that have been accepted or transferred
### Nessus
- Began as an open-source software project
- Nessus is free
	- for home user, business needs a license.
- Plug-ins
	- Created using Nessus Attack Scripting Language (NASL)
- you should be able to read and think through a vulnerability report
### OpenVAS and Qualys
- OpenVAS
	- now the open source vuln scanner
	- began from Nessus codebase when Nessus went paid for business
- Qualys
	- cloud-based vuln management solution with sensor agents at various points in network and sensors upload data to the cloud platform for analysis
- Exam tip:
	- you don’t need to know a vuln scanner, but you should be able to read the output.
