### Asset and Change Management
- We gotta know what’s on our network
- Asset Tagging
	- practice of assigning an ID to assets to associate them with entries in an inventory database
	- could be a barcode or an RFID tag on the device
	- asset tags correlate with asset records containing vendor documentation, configuration and warranty
- Change Management
	- the process through which changes to the configuration of information systems are monitored and controlled, as part of the organization’s overall configuration management efforts
	- Things to focus on:
		- Configuration information
		- Patches installed
		- Back Records
		- Incident reports/issues
	- ensures all changes are planned and controlled to minimize risk of a service disruption
	- changes are categorized according to their potential impact and level of risk
		- Major
		- Significant
		- Minor
		- Normal
- How to request change?: Request for Change (RFC)
	- Document that lists the reason for a change and the procedures to implement that change
	- major or significant changes require approval from the Change Advisory Board (CAB)
- Changes should be accompanied by a rollback or remediation plan
- so, to implement this change, they will have maintenance windows for authorized downtime
	- gotta work overnight during these windows
- Exam tip ^exam-tip
	- How might you install a patch or change? Change Management
		- you gonna disrupt everything if you patch something? figure it out.
	- Don’t Panic
### Network Architecture
- Physical Network
	- cabling, switch ports, router ports and wireless access points that supply cabled and wireless network access and connectivity
	- gotta find out if someone can get in and intercept your network.
	- physical security controls are important to protecting your physical network architecture
- Virtual Private Network (VPN)
	- secure tunnel created between two endpoints connected via an unsecure network, usually over the internet
	- Kinds of VPN:
		- IPSec
		- Secure Shell (SSH)
		- Transport Layer Security (TLS)
	- VPNs use authentication and authorization mechanisms to control access
	- VPNs good
	- But beware…the remote computer may be in danger!
		- also data leak
- Software-Defined Networking (SDN)
	- APIs and compatible hardware allowing for programmable network appliance and systems
	- SDN creates more complex networks due to their size, scope and ability to rapidly change
	- three planes
		- Control plane
			- make decisions about how traffic should be prioritized and secured, and where it should be switched
		- Data plane
			- handles the switching and routing of traffic and imposition of access control lists (ACL) for security
		- Management plane
			- monitors traffic conditions and network status
			- use management plane to control the other two
- Exam tips ^exam-tip
	- don’t need to know the planes
	- physical network needs protection too
### Segmentation
- different types of segmentations
- System isolation (air gap)
	- network isolation that physically separates a network from all other networks.
	- has management issues
	- for stuff you don’t want the internet to touch mostly
- Physical Segmentation
	- each network segment has its own switch, and only devices connected to that switch can communicate with each other
	- having your router be the communicator between multiple hubs
- Virtual Segmentation
	- Network segmentation that relies on VLANs to create equivalent segmentation that would occur if you used physical switches
	- the same as above, but virtually
- Zones
	- the main unit of a logically segmented network where the security configuration is the same for all hostess within it.
	- we use Access Control Lists (ACLs) to control who can go in to these zones
	- will usually zone off things that face the internet, called a Demilitarized Zone (DMZ)
### Jumpbox
- the first  2/3 of this is about the DMZ
- We use a jumpbox to configure our DMZ
	- hardened server that provides access to other hosts in the DMZ
- admins connect to the jumpbox, then through that, to the hosts in the DMZ
- can be physical or virtual, don’t matter.
	- prefer virtual to blow up an image if it becomes compromised
- the jumpbox and management workstation should only have the minimum required software to perform their job and be well hardened
### Virtualization
- Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI)
	- virtualization implementation that separates the personal computing environment from a user’s physical computer
	- the Server performs all the application processing and data storage
	- some companies completely offload their IT infrastructure to a third-party service company using VDI
	- but, user has no local processing ability if the server or network is down
- Containerization
	- a type of virtualization applied by a host operating system to provision an isolated execution environment for an application
	- containerization enforces resource separation at the operating system level
	- ![[containers.png]]
	- Containers are logically isolated and cannot interface with each other
	- if the attacker compromises the host OS, they can get into the containers
		- and I’ve even heard of escaping containers as well
### Virtualized Infrastructure
- Virtual Hosts
	- virtualized computer that allows for the installation and configuration of its own operating system
	- these also need to be patched and hardened
	- it’s also super easy to deploy new VMs, but leads to VM Sprawl
		- an expansion of VMs being provisioned without proper change control procedures
		- just turn your shit off or bomb it
- Virtual Networks
	- virtual hosts are interconnected using virtual switches, router and other virtualized networking equipment as part of the hypervisor
	- ensure that mapping of these virtual hosts to physical hardware does not expose data or system access to risks
	- Virtual switches don’t always behave like physical switches and may fail to isolate traffic between hosts adequately
	- just use different NICs
- Management interface
	- management application that is located either on the physical host aht runs the VMs or on a centralized platform that oversees VMs from multiple physical hosts
	- use separation of duties by having different admins for hypervisor than for the servers and hosts
	- monitor the host platform for signs of resource exhaustion to prevent a denial of service to hosted VMs
### Honeypots
- “The best defense is a good offense”
- Active defense
	- the practice of responding to a threat by destroying or deceiving a threat actor’s capabilities
	- engagement with the threat actor
	- one of the ways is to let someone into a false part of your network
- Honeypot
	- a host set up with the purpose of luring attackers away from the actual network components and/or discovering attack strategies and weaknesses in the security configuration.
	- watch them work and see their TTPs
- Honeynet
	- an entire network setup to entice attackers
	- often set up by security companies to analyze behavior
	- all in service to attribute attackers
- Attribution
	- identification and publication of an attacker’s methods, techniques, and tactics as useful threat intelligence
- Annoyance strategies
	- relies on obfuscation
		- bogus DNS
		- web servers with decoy directories
			- “important” “financial” etc
		- port triggering and spoofing
- Hack Back
	- offensive or counterattacking techniques to identify the attacker and degrade their capabilities.
	- many legal and reputational implications to consider and mitigate before using active defense strategies
