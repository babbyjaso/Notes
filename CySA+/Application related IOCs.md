- check out application logs
- we’ll go over virtualization as well
### Anomalous Activity
- gotta look for stuff
- places to look:
	- Web apps
	- databases
	- DNS services
	- Remote access servers
- anomalous = unusual
- you do this shit
- some examples
	- Unexpected outbound communication
		- looking at all network connections are understood and approved
		- make sure you know who’s calling who
	- Unexpected output
		- unusual request patterns or responses
		- can indicate an ongoing or past attack
		- bonus: look for code by examining data base reads or HTTP response packet sizes
			- more bytes, more code
		- look out for strange strings as well
	- Service Defacement
		- when an attacker gains control of a web server and alters the presentation of the website.
		- white hat or black hat stuff.
		- restore a backup and fix it
### Service Interruptions
- not always an IOC
	- stuff breaks
- things to check
	- security services are prevented from running
	- processes running the server are compromised.
	- the service may be disabled by a DDoS/DoS
	- Excessive bandwidth usage is disrupting a service
	- None of these mean that you’re under attack
- Service analysis tools
	- Task Manager
	- services.msc
	- CLI: net start
	- PS: Get-Service
	- cron
	- systemctl
	- ps, top, etc. linux stuff
### Application Logs
- CHECK THE LOGS
- The Four Nations:
	- DNS Event Logs
		- logs each time the DNS server is asked for information
	- HTTP Access Logs
		- logs each time HTTP traffic had an error or pre-defined rules
		- checking the status codes
		- client based codes: 400 range
		- Server based codes: 500 range
		- some logs the header, which has both client and server codes hell yeah
		- the User-Agent field is cool, but can be easily spoofed
	- FTP Access Logs
		- contain FTP traffic
		- 530 = user needs to log in
		- 230 = user has logged in
		- 331 = password required
		- SSH access logs
	- SQL Event Logs
		- shows a lot of data about the database and the server of what’s running SQL
		- somethings you will see:
			- query operation performed
			- schema associated with the operation
			- object of the query
### New Accounts
- an attacker’s favorite persistence attack
- used to maintain access
- always monitor your new account creation.
- account and session tools
	- local users and groups
		- Win tool to manage local groups
	- AD Users and computers tool
		- AD’s management of users on a DC
	- can still be managed by net commands or WMIC or PS
	- Linux
		- `who`
			- shows what users are logged in, date they logged in
		- `w`
			- see above and returns remote host, idle time
		- `rwho`
			- client/server architecture that displays who
		- `lastlog`
			- shows /var/log/lastlog file
			- this shows the users that logged in, when they logged in
		- `faillog`
			- displays failed logins
- always remember that there are multiple ways to skin a cat
