### Risk Identification Process
- Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)
	- comprehensive process of evaluating, measuring, and mitigating the many risks that pervade an organization
- why is this adopted by orgs?
	- we gotta control the risk.
	- keep data confidential
	- avoid financial losses
	- avoid legal issues
	- maintain positive brand image
	- ensuring COOP (continuity of operations planned)
	- establishing trust and mitigating liability
	- meeting stakeholder’s objectives
		- you as an analyst are not going to make decisions, the stakeholders will
	- go to guide: NIST 800-39
- [[Frameworks, Policies, Procedures|Frameworks]]
	- Establish a strategic risk management framework that is supported by decision makers at the top tier of the organization
- Assess
	- identify and prioritize business processes/workflow
- Respond
	- mitigate each risk factor through the deployment of managerial, operational, and technical security controls
- Monitor
	- evaluate the effectiveness of risk response measures and identify changes that could affect risk management processes
- identification takes place by evaluating threats, identifying vulnerabilities, and assessing the probability of an event affecting an asset/process
- how do we measure risk?
	- Quantitative methods
	- Qualitative methods
### Conducting an Assessment
- most business assets have a specific value associated with them
	- assets typically are valued according to the cost created by their loss or damage
- three main categories you consider
	- Business continuity
		- loss associated with no longer being able to fulfill contracts and orders due to the breakdown of critical systems
	- legal
		- loss created by organizational liability due to prosecution or damages (criminal/civil)
	- reputational
		- loss created by negative publicity and the consequential loss of market position or consumer trust
- system assessments
	- the systematic identification of critical systems by compiling an inventory of the business process and the tangible and intangible assets and resources that support those processes
		- such as:
			- People
			- Tangible assets
			- Intangible assets
				- ideas, brand, etc.
		- procedures
	- how do these impact the various functions?
- Mission Essential Function (MEF)
	- business or organizational activity that is too critical to be deferred for anything more than a few hours
- Asset/Inventory Tracking
	- the use of a software or hardware solution to track and manage any assets within an organization
	- typically done in an asset management database
		- various metadata about one asset
### Risk Calculation
- Risk = Probability x Magnitude
	- Probability
		- chance or likelihood of a threat being realized
		- typically expressed as a percentage
	- Magnitude
		- the impact of a successful exploit or risk event
		- how severe will this thing be
		- typically expressed as a monetary value
- Quantitative
	- risk analysis method that is based on assigning concrete values to factors
	- AV x EF = SLE
		- Asset Value (AV)
		- Exposure Factor (EF)
		- Single Loss Expectancy (SLE)
		- only provides the value for a single loss
	- ALE Annual Loss Expectancy
		- the cost of a given risk on an annual basis based on the single loss expectancy
		- SLE x ARO = ALE
			- Annual Rate of Occurrence (ALO)
	- Executives and managers love this because it’s a dollar value
	- only issue is assigning value to things
	- sometimes the annual loss is cheaper than fixing the problem
- Qualitative
	- a risk analysis method that uses opinions and reasoning to measure the likelihood and impact of risk
	- ![[risk matrix.png]]

		- Traffic Light System
- Semi-quantitative
	- risk analysis method that uses a mixture of concrete values with opinions and reasoning to measure the likelihood and impact of risk
	- How much is the employee morale worth in dollars?
	- How much is your company’s reputation worth in dollars?
	- How much does it cost if your company’s network is down between 2 am and 4 am on july 22?
	- attempts to make a middle ground between qualitative and quantitative
### Business Impact Analysis
- a systematic activity that identifies organizational risks and determines their effect on ongoing, mission critical operations
- governed by metrics that express system availability
	- Maximum Tolerable Downtime (MTD)
		- longest period of time without a business can be inoperable without causing irrevocable business failure
		- how long can you last before you go bankrupt?
		- each process can have it’s own MTD
			- minutes to hours for critical functions
			- 24 hours for urgent functions
			- 7 days for normal functions
		- sets upper limit on the recovery time that system and asset owners need to resume operations
	- Recovery Time Objective (RTO)
		- the length of time it takes after an event to resume normal business operations and activities
		- time it takes to get minimum operations going
	- Work Recovery Time (WRT)
		- the length of time in addition to the RTO of individual systems to perform reintegration and testing of a restored or upgraded system following an event
		- time it takes to get systems back up
	- Recovery Point Objective (RPO)
		- longest period of time that an organization can tolerate lost data being unrecoverable
		- how often do you do your backups?
		- how long can you be without your data
### Risk Prioritization
- Risk mitigation
	- Risk response that reduces a risk to fit within an orgs risk appetite
	- risk deterrence or risk reduction: controls that can either make a risk incident less likely or less costly
- Risk avoidance
	- risk response that involves ceasing an activity that presents risk
		- more often than not, this is not a solution
- Risk transference
	- risk response that involves moving or sharing the responsibility of risk to another entity
		- buying insurance for your car, transfers financial risk to another entity
		- there is cyber insurance or outsource service
		- transferring liability
		- can’t transfer reputation damage
- Risk acceptance
	- risk response that involves determining that a risk is within the organization’s risk appetite and no countermeasures other than ongoing monitoring will be needed
- Risk Appetite
	- how much risk is your org willing to accept?
- Exam tip ^exam-tip
	- mitigation = adding controls
	- avoidance = changing plans
	- transference = insurance
	- acceptance = low risk
- Return on Security Investment
	- a metric to calculate whether a security control is worth the cost of deploying and maintaining it
	- ((ALE - ALE^m)-C)/C = ROSI
		- Annual Loss Expectancy (ALE)
		- Mitigation (m)
		- minus Cost (C)
		- divided by the Cost
- can’t make risk go away completely
### Communicating Risk
- translate things for executives by turning it into dollar value
### Training and Exercises
- table top exercises, etc
