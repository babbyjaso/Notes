### Supply Chain Assessment
- secure working in an unsecure environment involves mitigating the risks of the supply chain
- org must ensure that the operation of every element is consistent and tamper resistant to establish a trusted computing environment
	- hardware, software and OS to all this stuff
- Due Diligence
	- a legal principle that a subject has used best practice or reasonable care when setting up, configuring or maintaining a system
- What should we be looking out for with due diligence?
	- properly resources cybersecurity program
	- security assurance and risk management processes
	- product support life cycle
	- security controls for confidential data
	- incident response and forensics assistance
	- general and historical company information
- due diligence should apply to suppliers AND contractors
- DOD created a thing called the Trusted Foundry
	- a microprocessor manufacturing utility that is part of a validated supply chain (one where hardware and software does not deviate from its documented function)
	- operated by the DoD
- Hardware Source Authenticity
	- the process of ensuring that the hardware is procured tamper-free from trustworthy suppliers
	- greater risk of inadvertently obtaining counterfeited or compromised devices when purchasing from second-hand or aftermarket sources
### Root of Trust
- Hardware Root of Trust (ROT) ^ROT
	- cryptographic module embedded within a computer system that can endorse trusted execution and attest to boot settings and metrics
	- TPM in your BIOS
	- used to scan the boot metrics and OS files to verify their signatures, and uses it to sign the report of trust
- Trusted Platform Module (TPM) ^TPM
	- specification for hardware-based storage of digital certificates, keys, hashed passwords, and other user and platform identification information.
	- just remember that this is the part of the system that ensures a secure boot
	- TPM can be managed in windows via the tpm.msc console or through group policy
- Hardware Security Module (HSM) ^HSM
	- appliance for generating and storing keys that is less susceptible to tampering and insider threats than software-based storage
	- lots of different form factors:
		- internal card
		- rack mounted
		- IoT thing
	- removes the person from the equation.
- Anti-tamper ^anti-tamper
	- methods that make it difficult for an attacker to alter the authorized execution of software
	- anti-tamper mechanisms include:
		- Field programmable gate array (FPGA) ^65f1f6
			- processor that can be programmed to perform a specific function by a customer rather than at the time of manufacture
		- physically unclonable function (PUF)
		- if someone tries to tamper with the system, will 0 out the keys
### Trusted Firmware
- trying to prevent a firmware exploit by using this
- firmware exploit gives an attacker an opportunity to run any code at the highest level of CPU privilege
- time to go over terms:
- UEFI
	- Unified Extensible Firmware Interface
	- type of system firmware providing support for 64-bit CPU operation at boot, full GUI and mouse operation at boot, and better boot security
	- almost all systems use UEFI
- Secure Boot
	- UEFI feature that prevents unwanted processes from executing during the boot operation
- Measured Boot
	- UEFI feature that gathers secure metrics to validate the boot process in an attestation report
	- takes different measurements as the system boots
- Attestation
	- a claim that the data presented in the report is valid by digitally signing it using the TPM’s private key
	- UEFI takes the report, signs it, shoots it to the processor and OS
- eFUSE
	- means for software or firmware to permanently alter the state of a transistor on a computer chip
	- one time programming used to seal the keys during firmware development
- Trusted Firmware Updates
	- firmware update that is digitally signed by the vendor and trusted by the system before installation
- Self-Encrypting Drives
	- disk drive where the controller can automatically encrypt data that is written to it.
### Secure Processing
- mechanism for ensuring the CIA triangle of software code and data as it is executed in volatile memory
- lots of way to do this:
- Processor security extensions
	- low-level cpu changes and instructions that enable secure processing
	- AMD
		- Secure memory encryption (SME)
		- Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV)
	- Intel
		- Trusted Execution Technology (TXT)
		- Software Guard Extensions (SGX)
- trusted execution
	- CPU’s security extensions invoke a TPM and secure boot attestation to ensure that  a trusted operating system is running
	- everything from the previous section?
- secure enclave
	- extensions that allow a trusted process to create an encrypted container for sensitive data
- atomic execution
	- certain operations that should only be performed once or not at all, such as initializing a memory location
- bus encryption
	- data is encrypted by an application prior to being placed on the data bus
	- ensure that the device at the end of the bus is trusted to decrypted the data
